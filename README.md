Game-of-Boggle
==============
Old code for boggle I found. Boggle Boggles Back will be it's successor. It will incorporate new skills i've learnt during this year of programming. This means enums, try catches, classes and hopefully part 3 crushed, along with implementation of a 2d array to hold the letters???? maybe!?
