Game-of-Boggle
==============
This version, 2.1 is my most recent code for a game of boggle. It relies on a text file which isn't included in this
repository, so you'll need to create one with the correct name.

This version is >400 lines shorter than my first attempt, however still needs much changing.

Any changes will be written at the top of the boggle.cs document from now on, along with being written here
